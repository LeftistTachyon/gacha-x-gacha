Welcome to the place where I(brighton lui) post incredidlbyl dumb shit (and lamen terms) for when people push commit messages.
If you're questioning why I have essentially no contributions to this project, its because A:
im dumb. 
But also because B:
all of my "contributions" are in the form of shitposting in this document.

I'll try to update this when people commit things, for your reading pleasure (or displeasure).
cheers :)

Now this is the initial commit, made by the one and only dej wang. Now hopefully, you have read the readme part of this proj,
and are informed that this is a gacha style game. normally, i would already be spewing crap about obama and whatnot, but I 
need to give you exposition on what this project is, and who the hell is creating it. The project will most likely be
carried by dej wang :((. so yeah here dej is creating the skeleton in maven, blah  blah blah some other stuffs and whatnot 
so the worst weaboo game can be created. maven sounds a lot like the letter m, because m is made of multiple chicken
nuggets. Sorry I got a bit off track there. dej is also implementing some java coding , so its legible by everyone else 
except dej and galvin. this commit message was pretty normal, but we'll see how that keeps up.
