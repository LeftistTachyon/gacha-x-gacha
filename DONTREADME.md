Welcome to the place where I(brighton lui) post incredidlbyl dumb shit (and lamen terms) for when people push commit messages.
If you're questioning why I have essentially no contributions to this project, its because A:
im dumb. 
But also because B:
all of my "contributions" are in the form of shitposting in this document.

I'll try to update this when people commit things, for your reading pleasure (or displeasure).
cheers :)

Now this is the initial commit, made by the one and only dej wang. Now hopefully, you have read the readme part of this proj,
and are informed that this is a gacha style game. normally, i would already be spewing crap about obama and whatnot, but I 
need to give you exposition on what this project is, and who the hell is creating it. The project will most likely be
carried by dej wang :((. so yeah here dej is creating the skeleton in maven, blah  blah blah some other stuffs and whatnot 
so the worst weaboo game can be created. maven sounds a lot like the letter m, because m is made of multiple chicken
nuggets. Sorry I got a bit off track there. dej is also implementing some java coding , so its legible by everyone else 
except dej and galvin. this commit message was pretty normal, but we'll see how that keeps up.

Good afternoon salchichas el es tu maestro, tu madre. so today michelle obama decided to grace this golden earth with a paper
representation of how fat, grade odor (otherwise known as gordo[n ramsey])) is played. she also put some cute ghost things on 
the paper. And by some, i mean one. and now ive just informed, that im writing all of this for nothing, because these 
mechanics are old and stupid. if you would like to see the newer mechanics, look at uhh TRail no i mean Trial_Mechanic_Page.pdf
its in the repo somewhere, so you can go on a fun scavenger hunt :> . This paragraph is for (fat gordo) FGO_Mechanic_Page.pdf, 
so you can look at that for posteriety if you want sweetie. ok ill see you in the next youtube video. bye.

ok so in the wise words of jed wang, whats happening in uhh the commit called "SLKFDJLSKDJF ("slick-fff-duh-juu-lissk-dujufuf)"
he added a bunch of tests that test the other code which makes sure that the oterh code isnt bad, otherwise if its bad, then
a huge red x appears like ghandi when the british we're taking over india. ap connection. tbh i cant really understand the 
code cause i only know java but from what im hearing, the pom.xml file is being changed, which is just really broad html, so
that everything works and looks good. im so sorry if yall know what pom.xml is, and that I absolutely butchered the meaning.
but for the rest of yall, please assume that i know what im talking about, and trust my words completly. you are slowly 
getting sleepier and sleepier as your eyes gett heavier and heavier. on the count of 10, you will sleep. 10. sleep. haha now
i wont wake you up ever because you suck and you should sleep for like a lot of years. good night.
